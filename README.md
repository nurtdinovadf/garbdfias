# Parsing GAR BD FIAS, Python Tutorial

## Intro
This repo contains a small but sufficient data chunk of [ГАР БД ФИАС](https://fias.nalog.ru/Updates) for this tutorial. Please note: file sizes are going to inflate ~10 times after extraction. Please make sure you have enough space on your disk.

If you want to work with up-to-date and full GAR database, you can find it [here](https://fias.nalog.ru/Updates). It is not guaranteed that the code will work for every region and update.

## Getting started
Just follow the [link to open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nurtdinovadf/garbdfias/blob/master/GAR16.ipynb). An explanation could be found [in the article]() (TBD).
